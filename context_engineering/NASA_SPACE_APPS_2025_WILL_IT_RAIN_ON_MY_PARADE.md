## Challenge Summary

Develop an application that enables users to query the likelihood of adverse weather conditions ("very hot," "very cold," "very windy," "very wet," or "very uncomfortable") for a specific location and time using NASA Earth observation data. The app should provide personalized, customized interfaces for users planning outdoor events like vacations, hikes, fishing trips, or other activities.

---

## Problem Statement

### User Need

People planning outdoor events (vacations, hikes, parades, outdoor dining, trail activities, lake fishing, etc.) need to know the **probability** of adverse weather conditions for their chosen location and time. While many apps provide 1-2 week forecasts, there is a gap in tools that can:

1. Predict weather likelihood **several months in advance**
2. Use **historical weather data** to determine probabilities
3. Provide **location-specific** climate statistics
4. Show **trend data** on changing weather patterns

### Key Distinction

**This is NOT a weather forecast.** The challenge focuses on:
- Historical weather data analysis
- Statistical probability of weather conditions
- Long-term planning (months in advance)
- Climate trends and changes over time

**NOT:**
- Short-term weather predictions (1-2 weeks)
- Real-time weather conditions
- Traditional meteorological forecasting models

---

## Background Context

### Weather Planning Challenges

- Perfect weather is desired for outdoor activities but not guaranteed
- Users need accurate knowledge of weather likelihood for specific places and times
- Historical weather data provides valuable planning information
- "Bad weather" is subjective (e.g., heavy snow is bad for some, great for skiers)

### NASA Data Availability

NASA has collected **decades of global weather data** including:

#### Available Weather Variables

1. **Precipitation**
   - Rainfall amounts
   - Snowfall
   - Snow depth

2. **Temperature**
   - Average temperatures
   - Extreme temperature indices
   - Heat waves

3. **Wind**
   - Wind speed
   - Wind patterns

4. **Air Quality**
   - Dust concentration
   - Atmospheric conditions

5. **Cloud Cover**
   - Cloud coverage data
   - Sky conditions

6. **Humidity**
   - Moisture levels
   - Comfort indices

### NASA Models and Capabilities

NASA has developed models that can:
- Establish **typical weather conditions** for specific locations and times (season/month/day)
- Calculate **probabilities of extreme weather** conditions
- Identify **climate trends** and changes over time
- Determine if likelihood of extreme events (heavy rain, dangerous temperatures, heat waves) is increasing

---

## Challenge Objectives

### Primary Objective

Develop an application that uses **NASA Earth observation data** to enable users to create a **personalized dashboard** for obtaining information about the likelihood of specified weather conditions at a selected location and time.

### Core Functionality Requirements

#### 1. Location Input Methods

Users must be able to specify location through one or more methods:
- Type in the name of a place (city, landmark, etc.)
- Draw a boundary on a map
- Drop a "pin" on an existing map
- Coordinate entry (latitude/longitude)

#### 2. Time Selection

Users must be able to specify:
- Day of the year
- Season/month
- Specific date ranges
- Time periods for analysis

#### 3. Weather Variable Selection

Users should be able to query:
- Temperature (hot/cold extremes)
- Precipitation (rain, snow)
- Wind speed (windy conditions)
- Air quality
- Humidity (uncomfortable conditions)
- Other relevant weather variables

#### 4. Data Presentation

The app should provide:
- **Statistical analysis:** Mean values over time for specified variables
- **Probability thresholds:** Likelihood of exceeding certain thresholds (e.g., "60% chance or higher of extreme heat above 90Â°F")
- **Visual representations:** Graphs or maps illustrating weather event probabilities
- **Text explanations:** Simple, clear descriptions accompanying visualizations

#### 5. Data Export Capability

Users should be able to:
- Download output files containing query results
- Access data subsets relevant to their specific query
- Export data for the specified location and time of interest

---

## Potential Considerations

### 1. Data Export Formats

**Recommendation:** Provide downloadable data in standard formats:
- **CSV (Comma Separated Values):** For spreadsheet applications
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):** For programmatic access

**Include metadata:**
- Units for all variables
- Source data links
- Query parameters used
- Timestamp of data generation

### 2. User Interface Assumptions

**Expected user knowledge:**
- Users will likely understand basic weather variables (rainfall, windspeed, dust concentration, temperature, etc.)
- Technical definitions may not be necessary in the interface
- Focus on intuitive presentation rather than educational content

### 3. Variable Selection Strategy

**Balance is critical:**

**DO:**
- Cover primary weather conditions relevant to outdoor activities
- Select the most useful/accurate data variable for each quantity
- Prioritize clarity over comprehensiveness

**DON'T:**
- Include too many variables (causes confusion)
- Duplicate similar variables (e.g., multiple types of rainfall data)
- Overwhelm users with technical options

**Example:** For rainfall, choose the most accurate/relevant rainfall dataset rather than offering 5 different rainfall variables.

### 4. Visual Representation Options

Consider multiple visualization approaches:

#### Graph Types
- **Bell curves:** Show range of probabilities and distribution
- **Time series:** Display trends over time for a specific point
- **Bar charts:** Compare probabilities across different conditions
- **Heat maps:** Show spatial distribution of probabilities

#### Map Options
- **Geographic displays:** Show probability data overlaid on maps
- **Area averages:** Display averages over specified geographic areas
- **Point-based data:** Precise location-specific information

#### Download Options
- Exportable charts and graphs
- Downloadable raw data
- Shareable visualizations

### 5. Statistical Analysis Tools

Leverage existing NASA services for:
- Data access and subsetting
- Statistical computations
- Probability calculations
- Trend analysis
